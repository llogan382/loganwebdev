Hi, I'm Luke, a frontend engineer. Currently I work on enterprise level react projects, but have spent time in the past doing SEO optimization, website migrations and updates, for both small and large-university level clients, CDN's, WordPress sites, automation and testing, etc. More recently Typescript, React Testing Library, and Storybook have been my focus.

## What's next?

My goal for 2022 is to obtain my second AWS certificate. This year (2021), I passed my [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-cloud-practitioner/?ch=tile&tile=getstarted) exam. Currently I am deciding between Devops and Architect, but hopefully the next few months will be helpful.


## Yeah, but what else?

Besides the tech-related fun, I am a dad to a pair of awesome little girls, a husband, a Christian, and I hope to run another half marathon in 2022. To stay healthy, I also like to do yoga once or twice a week- only in the comfort of my own home. I am far too shy to do it with other people, but it has helped me keep my back healthy, and it allows me the flexibility and strenght I need to not hesitate when my kiddos want to play.

We live in Greensboro, North Carolina where my wife and I were both born and raised. We have awesome families in the area, and it could not be a better setup.
